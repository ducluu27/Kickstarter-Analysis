Performing analysis by comparing succesful US Kickstarters and failed US Kickstarters for theaters. Our finds show that succesful Kickstarter theaters have a mean goal of $5,049, and failed ones have $10,554. An ideal goal amount for Kickstarting a theater would be about $4,000.
Also, attached is a chart showing how many failed, succesful, live and canceled theaters in Great Britain. The best time to start a theater is in May when it is at its peak as shown in the graph Outcomes based on launch dates ![Image_Name](https://github.com/ducluu27/Kickstarter-Analysis/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Dates.png/Outcomes_based_on_launch_dates.png).
